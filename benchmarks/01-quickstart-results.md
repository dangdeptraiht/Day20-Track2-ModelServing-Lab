## Observations

- TTFT is the prefill cost. With short prompts this is small; with long prompts it dominates.
- TPOT is per-token decode latency. The decode rate is `1000 / TPOT_p50`.
- The bigger quantization (Q4_K_M) is usually only ~30–60% slower than Q2_K but produces noticeably better text. Q2_K is for *truly* tight RAM.
- `n_threads = physical_cores` is usually best on CPU. Hyperthreading (`logical_cores`) often hurts because the work is bandwidth-bound.
